##  Wardley Complexity

The Problem this map doesn't seem to address is when a domain can't evolve because it is bound to other problems.

The Front End should be farther on the evolutionary axis. Plenty problems have been solved. But is bound together with little problems that in a place where we continue to solve the same problems.

We need a new model.
